# Ideas

- Particle effects for swords:
    - flames attached to the weapon
    - bloom
    - emit particles
- Particle effects for character
    - show breath
        - maybe even breathe fire?
    - rings of smoke when punching a surface
        - also shove a break texture on the area punched that dissapears over time
    - learn OpenGL, maybe stuff can be done better
        - investigate component shaders aswell...
- See what is possible with bevy_rapier's advanced collision detection
    - maybe punches can have nice flow and power?
    - dismemberment
    - can I reference bones based on the collision???
